## Dense Prediction
In computer vision pixelwise **dense prediction** is the task of predicting a label for each pixel in the image. Dense prediction task is producing dense output for the given input. In computer vision, unlike image classfication, tasks such as semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, etc. are considered as dense prediction task because label for each pixel is predicted.
